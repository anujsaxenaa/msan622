This will generate 4 images. The images are shown below.


## Plots ##

1)

I tried a different ggplot background than the default ggplot2. Not bad.

3)
![IMAGE](hw1-multiples.png)

I decided to remove the legend because I felt it was redundant information on the graph. I'm guessing it's self evident from the figure itself which facet
corresponds to which genre of movie.
