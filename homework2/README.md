## Discussion ##

##Aggregated Point Chart##
I was interested in know if the length of the Movie has a relationship with the IMDB rating. I aggregated the data on the length of the movie and plotted a scatter plot to see the relationship. I found there to be a positive correlation between the Ratings and Movie length. 

##Yearly Average Ratings##
I created a Yearly sorted table of the Year of release and the Average ratings in that year. I aggressed the table by yearly basis.

##Ratings by Genre##
I was interested in looking at average IMDB ratings by specific Genre. The table gives me information in a short concise manner.
