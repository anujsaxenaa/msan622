##Overview
The dataset that I used for my final project is of Meteorite Landings provided online for free by the Meteoritical Society. Over the past decade, this field has received major international attention. It has even been said that meteorite landings have become more common in recent years and scientist all over the world are eager to learn what mysteries of the universe in presented on our doorstep. Billions of dollars of fundings are being put into action by space research associations of all major countries such as USA, Russia, France etc. With this in mind, this dataset provides us with interesting insights as to how the history of meteorite landings has happened on earth. 

To add to that, this dataset has been acclaimed to be a terrific prototype for a good data visualization exercise.  
And being the spatially intelligent dominant person that I am, I was fascinated by the prospects of this dataset. I initially did not have any concrete plan of actions for going about this task, but I was motivated nonetheless. Visualizing.org also hosted a visualization competition on this dataset. Even though competitors used fancy javascript skills, I planned to use the power of R, ggplot2, shiny to the max.

## 1. History of Meteorite Landings##

Techniques:

The first thought that came to my mind was pretty obvious. I wanted to visualize how the meteorites landed on earth. This was easier said than done as I faced many issues that made me compromise on my idea. For achieving the most, I used the combination of ```time series``` and ```geospatial mapping``` techniques. These two techniques were helpful and were the main basis of this visualization. Since there was a vast range in the mass values of meteorites, I decided to scale sizes using ```scale_size``` to be between (2,13). This way I could control the data density and be able to display all points nicely. I used an ```alpha``` level of 0.6 for maintaining a good data ink ratio and make the map look less dense. I colored the meteorites based on the two kinds that were there, namely ```Found``` and ```Fell```. Found meteorites are found on the year reported and fell meteorites are reported to be seen falling in that reported year. I started my timeline from 1600 to 2013 as there were few and far in between observations before 1600.

The main takeaway of this visual is not only to see how the distribution of the meteorite landings, but also notice where both ```Fall``` and ```Fell``` meteorites landed over history. After plotting the graph, one can easily make out a certain pattern in the distribution between these two. On getting inference from the information presented, I was able to come up with some hypothesis. For example, there are more ```Fell``` meteorites in geographic locations with high populations on average from 1600-2013. i.e. there were always people present for reporting (and more possibly documenting) a live meteor crash landing. ```Found``` meteorites on the other hand appear more at colonized locations, where meteorologists later on found fallen meteorites. 

Interactivity:
For interactivity, I used the ```sliderInput``` function of ```shinyUI```. I implemented the ```animate``` function that enables me to automatically see the changes in my map over time. I looked at the changes happening on a decade level by setting the ```step``` as 10 years.

## 2. Distribution and Location of Found & Fell meteorites
Histogram:

Techniques: This plot shows the distribution of ```Fell``` and ```Found``` meteorites over time. I used ```geom_histogram``` with a ```bin``` size of one to look at the granularity of the distribution. From the plot, we can see that for both ```Found``` & ```Fell``` meteorites, the distribution appears to be negatively skewed, i.e. more observations are from the recent years than in earlier years. The skew for ```Found``` meteorites is severely negative. One reason could be because more than 99% of all the meteorites in Antarctica were found after 1970. Antarctica is a hub for meteorite landings with about 20,000 reports occurring there alone. The uninhabited and untapped nature of the continent might have played a factor in preserving the history of meteorite landings. To add to that, even for ```Fell``` meteorites the occurrences have been more in recent years. The underlying reasons could be either that more meteorites have been crashed in recent times or that meteor detecting has become more advanced and efficient. To view the granularity of the distribution, I set the ```binwidth``` to 1. The ```Fell``` histogram is inverted to represent the meteorites falling.

Interactivity:
I added a ```sliderInput``` which can highlight on the histogram the range of years that we select. This works over any range of years that we are interested in looking at. The ```sliderInput``` is used for the next visualization as well.

Orthogonal Maps:

Techniques: This plot is very useful if seen alongside the previous histogram as it provides the location parameter. I used the ```coord_map()``` functionality in ```ggplot``` to get a orthogonal map and selected the below four orientations that pretty much cover the entire globe. From this visual, we can see how filtering by year subsets the points on the map to show only a selected time frame in history. The Antarctica example that I mentioned above can be clearly inferred from this visualization. To have good data density, I scaled the sizes of the points using ```scale_size``` to be between (2,13). I choose ```alpha``` to be 1/6 for maintaining a good data ink ratio. 

Interactivity:
The interval ```sliderInput``` is used in this plot to highlight only those observations that are within the given time frame.

## 3. Looking at Each Country
Techniques: With abundant observation points at my disposal, I decided to look more close by viewing the country level meteorite landings. I created the country column using the ```map.where``` function to map the meteorite coordinates to the right country. I used ```geom_polygon``` function and used latitude and longitude coordinates for each country. With this, I could now plot individual countries and get a zoomed in view of meteorite landing in each country. 

Interactivity: I used the ```selectInput``` function from the ```shinyUI``` to select a particular country. 

## 4. Country-level statistics 
Techniques: In this plot, I show the top 5 meteorites (with names) with regards to mass for each country. I used ```geom_bar``` and ```coord_flip``` to achieve the plot orientation. My plot function creates a new data frame on the top 5 meteorites every time I change the country. This additional heuristic along with the the country plot gives us a brief summary and understanding of meteorite landings for each individual country.

Interactivity: The interactivity uses the ```selectInput``` function that changes the bar graph alongside the country graph.

## Changes after the prototype feedback

Overview of the original prototype.
The prototype consisted of a time series map(similar to the one above) equipped with the ```animate``` option. There was an option for changing the orientation of the map as we went through time by using a ```selectInput``` to change the orientation of the map. I removed this option and used orthogonal projections instead with ```sliderInput``` having an interval setting. That made more sense to me as the previous way was counterproductive. 

The two main suggestions on the prototype were:
- To show other information using a non-geospatial technique.
- To highlight countries that I selected on the bigger map.

Changes made after:

- I added non-geospatial plots that gave me additional information on other aspects of the data and gave me good insights.

Feedback I found helpful:

- The feedback had good points on the orthogonal mapping of the world map, therefore, I made four of them to show different angles of the earth.

Feedback I disagree with(or found challenging):

- I was told that when I’m zooming to a specific country, it would be good I can somehow show a 3d map of the country. This would result in an additional map which I did not want to display as I already had many maps.

## Challenges

- My initial main challenge was getting the animation for the time series within the right time frame. Since my data frame was more than 30,000 rows, this proved to be a challenge. However, using suggestions from the prototype feedback, I was able to overcome this problem and could now successfully run the animated time series.
- I had a tough time in mapping countries using the latitude and longitude coordinates. Because for countries that have island territories far from mainland, the zoomed version of that country wasn’t that magnified. If I had more time, I would come up with a solution by making hardcoded conditions for the country.
- Going back to highlighting a selected country, I couldn’t figure out the coloring scheme on time. I had some unusual errors that made this easy problem more confounding than it should actually be.
- I had a feature called ```Meteor Class``` which was categorical with 400+ categories. I would have loved to research on those and try to cluster the categories into a lesser number and present it visually.
- I also wanted to find some news related data that was related to meteor crashes (for major meteorites). It would have been interesting to see that heuristic in a visual form.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I really liked working on the final data visualization project. I can now comfortably make any kind of visualization that I want to. This class triggered a lot of my creative side which I throughly enjoyed dwelling into. I now have developed this thinking that data visualization is more than it is and plays a major portion in the broad Data Science pipeline. Moving forward, I plan on creating more visualizations that are not just info graphics, but are strong on the quant aspect, i.e. presenting statistical inferences, models in a visual form. I’m sure this has terrific benefits and I would be happy in indulging in such projects.
